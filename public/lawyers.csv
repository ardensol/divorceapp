          City        ","
          State/Province        ",,"Recognized by his peers for many years as one of the leaders of New York’s matrimonial bar and an accomplished divorce lawyer, he  serve as National President of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (2012-2013) and is listed in both annual publications Best Lawyers in America and Super Lawyers. Alton is currently the Chair of the 2,600 member Family Law Section of the New York State Bar Association.  His opinions and comments on a range of divorce and family law topics are often quoted by the national and local news media. He has lectured and written on many family law subjects for numerous bar associations and for various legal publications, and is one of the foremost advocates favoring the reform of New York’s divorce laws by the enactment of “no fault divorce.” Throughout his career, spanning forty years, Alton has held and continues to hold important positions in leading bar associations. He is also a Diplomate of the prestigious American College of Family Trial Lawyers, which limits its membership to 100 lawyers from across the United States. Alton is a member of the Matrimonial Practice Advisory Committee of the New York State Judicial Institute, Office of Court Administration. From the earliest days of his career until the present, Alton has represented clients in divorce and other family law matters, for which he seeks to find well-reasoned and comprehensive solutions to serious problems that have a long term impact on the lives of the people who have chosen him as their advocate. He employs all of the tools that are at the fingertips of matrimonial lawyers – from negotiation to litigation to appeals. His name appears as counsel of record on a wide-ranging group of reported court decisions. When asked why he does this kind of work, Alton often responds that helping people from a wide variety of backgrounds, possessing vastly divergent personalities, while learning the intricacies of all kinds of businesses and professions is interesting, challenging and rewarding. He views himself as extraordinarily fortunate to have had the opportunity to represent individuals, who are prominent in their own fields. Alton tries to never lose sight of the fact that each of his clients is important in their own right. He strives to treat each case with the thoughtfulness that clients expect of him, while keeping in mind the often sensitive issues that must be addressed in a confidential and delicate manner. He is admitted to practice law in the State of New York, the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the United States Supreme Court. With his wife and daughter, Alton resides in Manhattan
