We understand the issues involved in family law start with the law but involve much more. Divorce, custody, child support and grandparent access are also matters of the heart. Obtaining favorable results for our clients out of court is a hallmark of our firm. For our clients, we consider the court to be equivalent to an emergency room. You don't want to be there unless you have to be. However, in the event the courts are necessary, we believe our ability to aggressively pursue our clients' rights while maintaining a 'high road' approach has provided better outcomes from the courts.
