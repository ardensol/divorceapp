            California          ",http://www.aaml.org/divorce-lawyer-san-rafael-california-renee-chernus,"During the past four decades, Jaffe and Clemens’ co-founding partner Bruce Clemens has attracted a well-deserved following from sophisticated high-profile clients who seek the confidential family law services that the firm offers. Over those years, Bruce has successfully handled hundreds of complex marital dissolutions with an aggregate net worth in the tens of billions of dollars. The key to his success is a combination of highly polished legal skills and a stainless steel devotion to discretion. As a part of his philosophy of keeping his clients matters private, Bruce avoids media contact and declines to identify past or current clients.

Since its founding in 1980, the California Board of Legal Specialization, State Bar of California, has recognized Bruce as a Certified Specialist in Family Law. In addition, he has the distinction of being a Fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (AAML). Likewise, numerous publications have honored him, including the Best Lawyers in America and the Best Lawyers in American Family Law Lawyer. Los Angeles Magazine listed Bruce in the “Top 100 Southern California Super Lawyers” from all practice areas. In 2010, Bruce was named the Best Lawyers in America Family Law Lawyer of the Year.

Bruce’s peers recognize his knowledge, scholarship and experience throughout the field of family law. As evidence of his strong involvement with the legal community, he has taught over 20 courses for CEB, the University of Southern California Law Center, UCLA School of Law, the AAML, and many other professional organizations. He has also made significant contributions to the family law dialogue by publishing articles on topics such as the tax consequences of dissolution as well as prenuptial agreements and martial termination settlements. He formerly served on the Executive Committees of the Family Law Sections of the Los Angeles County Bar Association and the Beverly Hills Bar Association.
