As evidence of his strong involvement with the legal community, he has taught over 20 courses for CEB, the University of Southern California Law Center, UCLA School of Law, the AAML, and many other professional organizations.

","LEADERS IN FORENSIC DIVORCE

When you are facing a divorce, the need for a skilled family law attorney is a given. But often, economic and tax issues surrounding dissolution of a marriage also demand financial expertise. Dividing property not only has a tax impact, but the settlement you make will affect you for years to come. If children are involved, both settlement and issues of child custody, child support and visitation add to the realm of knowledge your attorney must have to achieve the best possible results to secure your future.

Among a select few Chicago law firms with expertise in business valuation and forensic accounting, Levin & Brend offer a broad spectrum of legal and financial services related to matrimonial law.

At Levin & Brend we are uniquely prepared to investigate and evaluate the value of assets in divorce cases, including stock portfolios, mutual funds, pension plans, 401Ks, real estate, closely held businesses, mortgages and loans. Our attorneys also handle business transactions and document changes brought about by divorce. In addition, certification as fraud examiners and business appraisers enable us to provide further dimension to the expertise we offer our clients.

Skaggs is on the forefront of new developments in the practice of family law, and is recognized for her innovation in the field as well as her continued dedication to families, children and public service. She received the Louisville Bar Associations 2006 Revell Family Law Award in honor of these commitments.  Past President of the Kentucky Chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Attorneys, where she currently serves on the national Board of Governors, Skaggs takes an active role in professional organizations and frequently teaches other family law attorneys and judges at continuing legal education courses. She is A.V. rated by Martindale-Hubbell, listed in Best Lawyers in America in the field of family law (Copyright 2012 Woodward/White, Inc. of Aiken S.C.) and selected for inclusion in 2007 through 2012 Super Lawyers as being among the top 5% of family lawyers and one of the top 25 women lawyers in Kentucky across all fields of practice. The Kentucky Chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers honored her with its 2010 Raising the Bar Award.  Her most recent honor is being elected a Diplomate of The American College of Family Trial Lawyers, a national organization limited to 100 divorce litigators, and the only Kentucky member.
Skaggs, who received her Juris Doctor degree from the Louis D. Brandeis School of Law at the University of Louisville in 1982, maintains professional memberships and has held offices in several regional and national organizations. She formed Diana L. Skaggs + Associates in 1999, although she has devoted her practice to family law for more than twenty-five years. 
Though the firm focuses on all aspects of divorce and family law, Skaggs concentrates her practice in complex financial divorce, including business valuation, trusts, tax, tracing of non-marital funds and integrated solutions for wealth management and preservation.
While most matters are settled privately, my extensive trial experience and our staffing allow us to handle complex litigation where necessary or appropriate, says Skaggs.

Working with each new client has proved very satisfying over the years.  I try to focus clients on the future, letting them know that they will be taking with them an appropriate share of the family resources. Clients are relieved to hear that they are not going to have to make decisions about their future until they know they will be all right.  This means becoming familiar with the changing dynamics of the family structure, parenting time, budgeting and  financial planning.  Importantly, I let them know that I will be there for them as they acquire this confidence. I'm now practicing in Arizona as well as Michigan.

            Michigan          ",http://www.aaml.org/divorce-lawyer-birmingham-michigan-b-andrew-rifkin,"As a family law attorney with more than 23 years of experience, I have helped many clients make life-altering decisions and have guided them through the most challenging periods of their lives. My goal always is to serve as a problem-solver for my clients, who routinely come to me with difficult issues surrounding divorce, property valuation and division, child custody, financial support, and many other family law concerns. I offer all of my clients a place where they can be heard, receive practical advice based on their goals and objectives, and develop a sound plan for moving through their divorces and forward with the next phases of their lives. 

I realize that every family and every case is unique, and I tailor my approach accordingly. My overarching belief is that busy family court judges do not have time to fully understand and creatively solve complex problems, making public courtroom litigation often a poor choice for resolving difficult issues.  Since litigation also is acrimonious and expensive, it rarely leads to a lasting peace or a thorough, cost-effective result.  For that reason, I frequently work with my clients (and often one or more other specialists from our team of carefully-selected professionals) to resolve their disputes privately and confidentially, outside of the courtroom.  Sometimes, for example, I am able to work with an experienced counselor to put a couple on a path to reconciliation; other times, I use private negotiation or mediation to help resolve difficult issues.  In those cases where courtroom litigation is unavoidable, I use my experience and expertise to advocate zealously on behalf of my clients. I have tried cases to judges and juries in federal and state courts throughout Michigan, and I successfully have represented clients in proceedings in Michigan, Illinois, California, and Colorado.

My approach has won the trust and confidence of my clients as well as my peers.  I am a Fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, and for each of the last 10 years, I have received the highest possible rating of legal ability and ethical standards, the Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating AV Preeminent¢ 5.0 out of 5.  I also have been recognized as one of the premier family law attorneys in Michigan:  I again was named to Best Lawyers in America for 2015, as a Top Lawyer by dBusiness Magazine, and as a Michigan Super Lawyer. 

I graduated with Distinction from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and as a member of the Honors College. After attending the University of Michigan Medical School for a year, I went on to the University of Michigan Law School, where I won the Henry M. Campbell Moot Court Competition and taught legal research and writing.  I am also an adjunct professor of law at Michigan State University College of Law, and I previously taught at the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law.

By creating the concept of a more honest, personalized and direct way to practice family law, Richard Victor has instilled a new philosophy, in his firm in order to bring integrity to the practice of family law. Mr. Victors personal belief is that lawyers who practice family law should have a higher duty to their clients then in most other areas of law. At The Law Offices of Richard S.

Recognizing the special nature of matrimonial and family law proceedings, Sonja has dedicated her career to serving individuals whose diverse cases frequently involve significant holdings, business valuation, property settlement, support issues, custody and parenting time issues, antenuptial (prenuptial) agreements, and trust and estate planning. Sonja works with each individual to craft a resolution that addresses the unique nature of each case. If further expertise is required, Sonja draws upon the rich knowledge and experience of over 180 attorneys at Lindquist & Vennum.  

In addition to her law degree, Sonja possesses an LL.M. (Master of Laws) degree in tax and estate planning. Sonjas Master of Laws degree sets her apart from other family law attorneys as it gives her a keen ability to assist clients with high income, substantial net worth, and complex financial holdings. Recognizing the financial and emotional aspects of every proceeding, Sonja applies her detailed knowledge of tax strategies, business valuation, and cash flow to quickly analyze the case and develop a plan for swift resolution that minimizes conflict. Over the past 23 years, Sonja has advised on numerous dissolution proceedings with asset values ranging from $1 million to over $200 million.  

Sonja has been granted fellowship in the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, a distinction shared by only a few attorneys in Minnesota. She currently serves on the Board of Managers and also serves as co-chair of the Substantive Law Committee for the Academy. In addition, Sonja is a trained mediator and serves on the panel of qualified Hennepin County Financial Early Neutral Evaluators.  

Sonja grew upon on a farm in southern Minnesota. She uses the common sense approach instilled in her to help clients maintain dignity and respect during the traumatic dissolution process. Sonja frequently encourages her clients to participate in mediation. She seeks to diminish the effects of divorce on children and families. When reasoned negotiation does not facilitate resolution, Sonja, an experienced litigator, advocates aggressively for her clients. ",Matrimonial and Family Law,"

            Minnesota          ",http://www.aaml.org/divorce-lawyer-minneapolis-minnesota-karen-schreiber,"Karen chairs Lindquist & Vennums Family Law practice group. She has devoted her practice exclusively to family law for 22 years, assisting clients with adoptions, prenuptial and postnuptial agreements, marriage dissolutions, child custody, parenting time (visitation) matters, paternity matters, and post-decree matters. Karen has extensive experience with marriage dissolutions involving closely held businesses; valuation and division of executive compensation; complex property settlements; child support; and spousal maintenance.

A primary benefit of Karens experience is the practical, common-sense approach she takes to family-related legal matters. Although she is a well-prepared and determined litigator when the situation demands it, she prefers to promote accord among family members and resolve issues early on, if possible. Her respect for and collaboration with all parties involvedfrom custody evaluators and accountants to judges and opposing counselhas led psychologists, accountants, clergy and attorneys throughout Minnesota to regularly refer clients to her.

Karens knowledge, capabilities and approach have made her an attorney of choice for clients with complicated financesinvolving, for example, tax issues, trusts, complex forms of compensation and multiple business interests. She helps clients work through such situations by performing continuing cost-benefit analyses and providing clients with the information they need to make informed decisions at each step in the process.

Karen is one of a limited number of attorneys in the Twin Cities who have met the criteria and passed the rigorous admissions process to be admitted as a fellow in the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, where she serves on the board of managers. She is also a member of the family law sections of the Minnesota and American bar associations; a former chair of the Hennepin County Bar Associations Family Law Section; and a Rule 114 qualified mediator. In addition, she serves on the panel of qualified Hennepin County Financial Early Neutral Evaluators. ",Family Law,"

Working in the legal field appealed to me and I changed my direction to apply to law school.

 

 

 
","My primary focus is on family law cases. The choice of an attorney in a family case is as important as what process to select in family law cases, and my practice includes mediation, collaborative law, and litigation.

The relationship with your family lawyer is not at arms length, and it requires forming a partnership with your attorney. The issues are often complex and need focused attention to detail. I try to work with my clients to develop solutions to their problems and plan for their future.

Alton is currently the Chair of the 2,600 member Family Law Section of the New York State Bar Association.  His opinions and comments on a range of divorce and family law topics are often quoted by the national and local news media. He has lectured and written on many family law subjects for numerous bar associations and for various legal publications, and is one of the foremost advocates favoring the reform of New Yorks divorce laws by the enactment of no fault divorce. Throughout his career, spanning forty years, Alton has held and continues to hold important positions in leading bar associations. He is also a Diplomate of the prestigious American College of Family Trial Lawyers, which limits its membership to 100 lawyers from across the United States. Alton is a member of the Matrimonial Practice Advisory Committee of the New York State Judicial Institute, Office of Court Administration. From the earliest days of his career until the present, Alton has represented clients in divorce and other family law matters, for which he seeks to find well-reasoned and comprehensive solutions to serious problems that have a long term impact on the lives of the people who have chosen him as their advocate. He employs all of the tools that are at the fingertips of matrimonial lawyers  from negotiation to litigation to appeals. His name appears as counsel of record on a wide-ranging group of reported court decisions. When asked why he does this kind of work, Alton often responds that helping people from a wide variety of backgrounds, possessing vastly divergent personalities, while learning the intricacies of all kinds of businesses and professions is interesting, challenging and rewarding. He views himself as extraordinarily fortunate to have had the opportunity to represent individuals, who are prominent in their own fields. Alton tries to never lose sight of the fact that each of his clients is important in their own right. He strives to treat each case with the thoughtfulness that clients expect of him, while keeping in mind the often sensitive issues that must be addressed in a confidential and delicate manner. He is admitted to practice law in the State of New York, the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the United States Supreme Court. With his wife and daughter, Alton resides in Manhattan

We understand the issues involved in family law start with the law but involve much more. Divorce, custody, child support and grandparent access are also matters of the heart. Obtaining favorable results for our clients out of court is a hallmark of our firm. For our clients, we consider the court to be equivalent to an emergency room. You don't want to be there unless you have to be. However, in the event the courts are necessary, we believe our ability to aggressively pursue our clients' rights while maintaining a 'high road' approach has provided better outcomes from the courts.

            Virginia          ",http://www.aaml.org/divorce-lawyer-fairfax-virginia-richard-gray,"I joined Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell LLP in January of 2014 as an attorney and partner in the family law department with the goal of helping client's finding solutions and moving forward in their lives, preserving assets and their relatonships post-divorce. I manage our Virginia office which is conveniently located at the intersection of Rte. 50 and West Ox Road in Fairfax, Virginia.

My Virginia-based law practice continues to be focused on all aspects of divorce, including spousal support, child support, custody and visitation, preparation of separation and property settlement agreements, drafting of premarital and post-marital agreements and division of retirement benefits for military and privately-funded 401(k) and IRA plans.

My trial work includes all aspects of litigated family law matters in both the Circuit and Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts throughout northern Virginia, including Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William, Arlington and Fauquier Counties and Alexandria City. I handle contested divorce cases (support, custody and visitation cases and equitable distribution cases) and post-divorce modification.

My approach when working with clients on these very personal family law matters is to become a trusted counselor and advisor in addition to providing the text book legal advice and in court representation. My background in psychology on both the undergraduate and graduate levels, enables me to empathize with my client's situation. I am sensitive to the fact that it takes time to understand and assimilate the facts of the case from my client's perspective.

Since 2000 my practice has been exclusively focused on Virginia Family Law and Domestic Relations litigation.

I am also trained as a family mediator and collaborative law attorney.

Please contact me at our Virginia office at 10480 Armstrong St., Fairfax, Va. 22030.

I am rated ""AV"", the highest rating given by Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings¢ for my legal ability and high ethical standards.

I have been fortunate to have been named among Virginia Business magazine's ""Legal Elite"" in 2009 and repeatedly listed among Northern Virginia Top Lawyers in The Northern VIrginia Magazine.  Since 2006 I have also repeatedly been nominated by my peers for inclusion in both the Virginia Super Lawyers - Family Law section and the Washington D.C. Super .Lawyers - Family Law section, including for calendar year 2014.

Prior to joining Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell LLP I was a partner in the family law section of Odin, Feldman & Pittleman (1999 - 2013).  Prior to that, I practiced law at my own firm in a general practice setting for 12 years.
