","LEADERS IN FORENSIC DIVORCE

When you are facing a divorce, the need for a skilled family law attorney is a given. But often, economic and tax issues surrounding dissolution of a marriage also demand financial expertise. Dividing property not only has a tax impact, but the settlement you make will affect you for years to come. If children are involved, both settlement and issues of child custody, child support and visitation add to the realm of knowledge your attorney must have to achieve the best possible results to secure your future.

Among a select few Chicago law firms with expertise in business valuation and forensic accounting, Levin & Brend offer a broad spectrum of legal and financial services related to matrimonial law.

At Levin & Brend we are uniquely prepared to investigate and evaluate the value of assets in divorce cases, including stock portfolios, mutual funds, pension plans, 401Ks, real estate, closely held businesses, mortgages and loans. Our attorneys also handle business transactions and document changes brought about by divorce. In addition, certification as fraud examiners and business appraisers enable us to provide further dimension to the expertise we offer our clients.

Past President of the Kentucky Chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Attorneys, where she currently serves on the national Board of Governors, Skaggs takes an active role in professional organizations and frequently teaches other family law attorneys and judges at continuing legal education courses. She is A.V. rated by Martindale-Hubbell, listed in Best Lawyers in America in the field of family law (Copyright 2012 Woodward/White, Inc. of Aiken S.C.) and selected for inclusion in 2007 through 2012 Super Lawyers as being among the top 5% of family lawyers and one of the top 25 women lawyers in Kentucky across all fields of practice.

            Michigan          ",http://www.aaml.org/divorce-lawyer-birmingham-michigan-b-andrew-rifkin,"As a family law attorney with more than 23 years of experience, I have helped many clients make life-altering decisions and have guided them through the most challenging periods of their lives. My goal always is to serve as a problem-solver for my clients, who routinely come to me with difficult issues surrounding divorce, property valuation and division, child custody, financial support, and many other family law concerns. I offer all of my clients a place where they can be heard, receive practical advice based on their goals and objectives, and develop a sound plan for moving through their divorces and forward with the next phases of their lives.†

I realize that every family and every case is unique, and I tailor my approach accordingly. My overarching belief is that busy family court judges do not have time to fully understand and creatively solve complex problems, making public courtroom litigation often a poor choice for resolving difficult issues. †Since litigation also is acrimonious and expensive, it rarely leads to a lasting peace or a thorough, cost-effective result. †For that reason, I frequently work with my clients (and often one or more other specialists from our team of carefully-selected professionals) to resolve their disputes privately and confidentially, outside of the courtroom. †Sometimes, for example, I am able to work with an experienced counselor to put a couple on a path to reconciliation; other times, I use private negotiation or mediation to help resolve difficult issues. †In those cases where courtroom litigation is unavoidable, I use my experience and expertise to advocate zealously on behalf of my clients. I have tried cases to judges and juries in federal and state courts throughout Michigan, and I successfully have represented clients in proceedings in Michigan, Illinois, California, and Colorado.

My approach has won the trust and confidence of my clients as well as my peers. †I am a Fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, and for each of the last 10 years, I have received the highest possible rating of legal ability and ethical standards, the Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating AV PreeminentÑ¢ 5.0 out of 5. †I also have been recognized as one of the premier family law attorneys in Michigan: †I again was named to Best Lawyers in America for 2015, as a Top Lawyer by dBusiness Magazine, and as a Michigan Super Lawyer.†

I graduated with Distinction from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and as a member of the Honors College. After attending the University of Michigan Medical School for a year, I went on to the University of Michigan Law School, where I won the Henry M. Campbell Moot Court Competition and taught legal research and writing. †I am also an adjunct professor of law at Michigan State University College of Law, and I previously taught at the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law.†

Recognizing the special nature of matrimonial and family law proceedings, Sonja has dedicated her career to serving individuals whose diverse cases frequently involve significant holdings, business valuation, property settlement, support issues, custody and parenting time issues, antenuptial (prenuptial) agreements, and trust and estate planning. Sonja works with each individual to craft a resolution that addresses the unique nature of each case. If further expertise is required, Sonja draws upon the rich knowledge and experience of over 180 attorneys at Lindquist & Vennum.  

In addition to her law degree, Sonja possesses an LL.M. (Master of Laws) degree in tax and estate planning. SonjaÄôs Master of Laws degree sets her apart from other family law attorneys as it gives her a keen ability to assist clients with high income, substantial net worth, and complex financial holdings. Recognizing the financial and emotional aspects of every proceeding, Sonja applies her detailed knowledge of tax strategies, business valuation, and cash flow to quickly analyze the case and develop a plan for swift resolution that minimizes conflict. Over the past 23 years, Sonja has advised on numerous dissolution proceedings with asset values ranging from $1 million to over $200 million.

When reasoned negotiation does not facilitate resolution, Sonja, an experienced litigator, advocates aggressively for her clients. ",Matrimonial and Family Law,"

She has devoted her practice exclusively to family law for 22 years, assisting clients with adoptions, prenuptial and postnuptial agreements, marriage dissolutions, child custody, parenting time (visitation) matters, paternity matters, and post-decree matters. Karen has extensive experience with marriage dissolutions involving closely held businesses; valuation and division of executive compensation; complex property settlements; child support; and spousal maintenance.

A primary benefit of KarenÄôs experience is the practical, common-sense approach she takes to family-related legal matters. Although she is a well-prepared and determined litigator when the situation demands it, she prefers to promote accord among family members and resolve issues early on, if possible. Her respect for and collaboration with all parties involvedÄîfrom custody evaluators and accountants to judges and opposing counselÄîhas led psychologists, accountants, clergy and attorneys throughout Minnesota to regularly refer clients to her.

KarenÄôs knowledge, capabilities and approach have made her an attorney of choice for clients with complicated financesÄîinvolving, for example, tax issues, trusts, complex forms of compensation and multiple business interests. She helps clients work through such situations by performing continuing cost-benefit analyses and providing clients with the information they need to make informed decisions at each step in the process.

Karen is one of a limited number of attorneys in the Twin Cities who have met the criteria and passed the rigorous admissions process to be admitted as a fellow in the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, where she serves on the board of managers. She is also a member of the family law sections of the Minnesota and American bar associations; a former chair of the Hennepin County Bar AssociationÄôs Family Law Section; and a Rule 114 qualified mediator. In addition, she serves on the panel of qualified Hennepin County Financial Early Neutral Evaluators. ",Family Law,"

Alton is currently the Chair of the 2,600 member Family Law Section of the New York State Bar Association. †His opinions and comments on a range of divorce and family law topics are often quoted by the national and local news media. He has lectured and written on many family law subjects for numerous bar associations and for various legal publications, and is one of the foremost advocates favoring the reform of New YorkÄôs divorce laws by the enactment of Äúno fault divorce.Äù Throughout his career, spanning forty years, Alton has held and continues to hold important positions in leading bar associations.

He employs all of the tools that are at the fingertips of matrimonial lawyers Äì from negotiation to litigation to appeals. His name appears as counsel of record on a wide-ranging group of reported court decisions.

We understand the issues involved in family law start with the law but involve much more. Divorce, custody, child support and grandparent access are also matters of the heart. Obtaining favorable results for our clients out of court is a hallmark of our firm. For our clients, we consider the court to be equivalent to an emergency room. You don't want to be there unless you have to be. However, in the event the courts are necessary, we believe our ability to aggressively pursue our clients' rights while maintaining a 'high road' approach has provided better outcomes from the courts.

            Virginia          ",http://www.aaml.org/divorce-lawyer-fairfax-virginia-richard-gray,"I joined Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell LLP in January of 2014 as an attorney and partner in the family law department with the goal of helping client's finding solutions and moving forward in their lives, preserving assets and their relatonships post-divorce. I manage our Virginia office which is conveniently located at the intersection of Rte. 50 and West Ox Road in Fairfax, Virginia.

My Virginia-based law practice continues to be focused on all aspects of divorce, including spousal support, child support, custody and visitation, preparation of separation and property settlement agreements, drafting of premarital and post-marital agreements and division of retirement benefits for military and privately-funded 401(k) and IRA plans.

My trial work includes all aspects of litigated family law matters in both the Circuit and Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts throughout northern Virginia, including Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William, Arlington and Fauquier Counties and Alexandria City. I handle contested divorce cases (support, custody and visitation cases and equitable distribution cases) and post-divorce modification.

My approach when working with clients on these very personal family law matters is to become a trusted counselor and advisor in addition to providing the text book legal advice and in court representation. My background in psychology on both the undergraduate and graduate levels, enables me to empathize with my client's situation. I am sensitive to the fact that it takes time to understand and assimilate the facts of the case from my client's perspective.

Since 2000 my practice has been exclusively focused on Virginia Family Law and Domestic Relations litigation.

I am also trained as a family mediator and collaborative law attorney.

Please contact me at our Virginia office at 10480 Armstrong St., Fairfax, Va. 22030.

I am rated†""AV"", the highest rating given by†Martindale-HubbellÆ Peer Review RatingsÑ¢†for my†legal ability and high†ethical standards.

I have been†fortunate to have been named among†Virginia Business†magazine's ""Legal Elite"" in†2009 and†repeatedly listed among Northern Virginia Top Lawyers†in The Northern VIrginia Magazine. †Since 2006 I have also†repeatedly†been nominated by my peers for inclusion in both the†Virginia Super Lawyers†- Family Law section and the†Washington D.C. Super .Lawyers - Family Law section, including for calendar year 2014.

Prior†to joining Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell LLP I was a partner in the family law section of Odin, Feldman & Pittleman (1999 - 2013).† Prior to that,†I†practiced law at my own firm in a general practice setting†for 12 years.
